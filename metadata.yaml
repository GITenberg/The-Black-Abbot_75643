summary: '"The Black Abbot" by Edgar Wallace is a mystery novel written in the late
  1920s. Set in an English estate, the story opens with the Earl of Chelford, who
  is embroiled in a discussion surrounding the myth of the Black Abbot, a ghost said
  to haunt Fossaway Manor. As the plot unfolds, themes of family secrets, treasure
  hunting, and romance intertwine, particularly involving Harry Alford and his brother
  Dick, along with the enigmatic figure of Leslie Gwyn.   At the start of the narrative,
  we are introduced to Lord Chelford and his footman Thomas as they discuss the sending
  of treasury notes, along with the eerie legend of the Black Abbot, which visibly
  agitates Chelford. He sternly warns Thomas against discussing the ghost and reveals
  his own fears, indicating that there might be more than just superstition at play.
  Meanwhile, the presence of the disgruntled former secretary, Miss Wenner, introduces
  a layer of romantic tension and intrigue, especially concerning the Earlâ€™s upcoming
  marriage and the potential for hidden treasures within the manor''s lore. The beginning
  deftly sets up a blend of mystery, personal drama, and supernatural elements that
  will surely engage readers intrigued by tales of haunted estates and the complexities
  of familial relationships. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
